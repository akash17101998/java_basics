Generics is used for the type safety, we can define the type of the data that is stored in list in <> this and if we not define the
type it will accept all the types

We can also mention generic type with class,
example :- class demo<T>{}
so when we create object of class, we can define the type of the data members
demo<String> d1 = new demo<>();
